        This build file is imported by the project build file. It contains
        all the targets and tasks necessary to build Android projects, be they
        regular projects, library projects, or test projects.

        At the beginning of the file is a list of properties that can be overridden
        by adding them to your ant.properties (properties are immutable, so their
        first definition sticks and is never changed).

        Follows:
        - custom task definitions,
        - more properties (do not override those unless the whole build system is modified).
        - macros used throughout the build,
        - base build targets,
        - debug-specific build targets,
        - release-specific build targets,
        - instrument-specific build targets,
        - test project-specific build targets,
        - install targets,
        - help target

   <!-- The ant.properties file can be created by you. It is only edited by the
    'android' tool to add properties to it.
    This is the place to change some Ant specific build properties.
    Here are some properties you may want to change/update:

    source.dir
    The name of the source directory. Default is 'src'.
    out.dir
    The name of the output directory. Default is 'bin'.

    For other overridable properties, look at the beginning of the rules
    files in the SDK, at tools/ant/build.xml

    Properties related to the SDK location or the project target should
    be updated using the 'android' tool with the 'update' action.

    This file is an integral part of the build system for your
    application and should be checked into Version Control Systems.

    This contains project specific properties such as project target, and library
    dependencies. Lower level build properties are stored in ant.properties
    (or in .classpath for Eclipse projects).

    <!-- Import the actual build file.
    To customize existing targets, there are two options:
    - Customize only one target:
    - copy/paste the target into this file, *before* the
    <import> task.
    - customize it to your needs.
    - Customize the whole content of build.xml
    - copy/paste the content of the rules files (minus the top node)
    into this file, replacing the <import> task.
    - customize to your needs.
